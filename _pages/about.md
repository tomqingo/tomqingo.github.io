Biography
------
I'm a Master student at the Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), China. I received my B.S. degree in Instrument Science and Engineering, SJTU in 2019. My research interests include kernel methods, neural network compression and computer vision. I am conducting the research on the random Fourier feature approximation for generalized kernels and its application.
